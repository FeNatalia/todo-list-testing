# TodoApp - React Web Application

This is a simple todo list app which allows you to stay organized when creating todos. You can add items, sort them by name, mark them done and store all this information directly on your web browser.

## How to use it 
When you use the app for the first time it will show you the instructions:

When you click `Add item` button, the form with one field (name) will appear, fill in this field and click `Ok` :

If you don't provide the field it will give you an error alert:

After successfully submitting your todos, you will see the items appear on your shopping list:

If you would like to sort the items by name from A to Z, click `Name A to Z` and it will sort :

If you would like to sort the items by name from Z to A, click `Name Z to A` and it will sort :

When you want to mark the todos done, click the checkbox by your item and it will now appear on the `View completed todos` list, click it to view:

When you click on `Add` button it will either show or hide the form. The same logic with the `View completed todos`, click to hide or view:
